VS Code extensions are a great way to enhance the experience of the already great editor of recent times. I tend to experiment different sort of extensions which can improve my workflow or help me fix some of the pain points.

In this article, I'm going to list down my favorite [VS Code extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) that I'm currently using myself and have helped me improvise my developer life quite significantly.

## [PHP Intelephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client)

I'm a PHP developer and my default IDE is [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) when it comes to working with PHP but sometimes I just want to open projects into VS Code for quick updates and this is where I miss PhpStorm's intelligence a lot. 

So, I was looking for an extension which can at least partially fulfil this gap and that's where I found PHP Intelephense which enables PHP code intelligence in VS Code.

Intelephense is a high-performance PHP language server packed full of essential features for productive PHP development. Here are some of the features of Intelephense that I love.

- Rapid workspace wide go to definition support.
- Workspace wide find all references.
- Detailed hover with links to official PHP documentation.
- Reads PHPStorm metadata for improved type analysis and suggestions.
- Lossless PSR-12 compatible document/range formatting.

Although the free version of this extension would be enough for your day-to-day need, there's also a [paid version](https://intelephense.com/) which add some additional features which you can if you like.

Install it by opening command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), paste the following command, and press enter.

```
ext install bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client
```

## [CSS Peek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek)

Ever wanted a functionality where you can jump to the CSS definition of the class right from where it's used?

[CSS Peek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek) can used just for that purpose. It allow peeking to CSS ID and class strings as definitions from html files to respective CSS. Allows peek and goto definition.

This extension extends `HTML` and `ejs` code editing with Go To Definition and Go To Symbol in Workspace support for css/scss/less (classes and IDs) found in strings within the source code.

Here is how to use it.

- **Peek**: Load the CSS file inline and make quick edits right there. (Ctrl+Shift+F12)

- **Hover**: Show the definition in a hover over the symbol. (Ctrl+hover)

## [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks)

One of the features I always missed in VS Code (coming from PhpStorm) is the ability to bookmark lines in the files. This is helpful in remembering important code snippets by assigning a label to it, so that you can access it later on.

Luckily, I found [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks) which gets the job done for me for this particular usecase.

It helps you to navigate in your code, moving between important positions easily and quickly by adding bookmarks. There are commands using which you can add/clear bookmarks. Here are some of the commands.

- `Bookmarks: Toggle Labeled` Mark labeled bookmarks
- `Bookmarks: Toggle` Mark/unmark positions with bookmarks
- `Bookmarks: Jump to Next` Move the cursor forward, to the bookmark below
- `Bookmarks: Jump to Previous` Move the cursor backward, to the bookmark above
- `Bookmarks: List` List all bookmarks in the current file

Few of the commands can also be found in the context menu when you right click in the line where you want to add a bookmark.

The Bookmarks extension has its own Side Bar, giving you more free space in your Explorer view. You will have a few extra commands available:

- Jump to Bookmark
- Edit Label
- Remove Bookmark
- Clear Bookmark's file
