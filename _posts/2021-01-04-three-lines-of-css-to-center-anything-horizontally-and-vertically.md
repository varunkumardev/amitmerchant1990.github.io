Oftentimes, I stumble across a situation where I would need to center something and over the years I have tried different permutations and combinations. But all those somehow felt *"hacky"* and not something that is reliable.

But then, recently I learned about this little trick which only requires three lines of CSS to center anything, horizontally and vertically. That too in a proper way! Check out the below CodePen first.

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="amit_merchant" data-slug-hash="abmGzqo" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Center anything">

As you can see, to center anything horizontally and vertically inside a container element, you would only need to give the following CSS to it like so.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

The `flex` property allows the container to have flexible items, the [align-items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items) property would center the content on the y-axis while the [justify-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content) would center the content on the x-axis.

And that's about it... All you'll need is to slap in these 3 lines of CSS to perfectly center anything and everything!

If you're a visual learner, there's a video that you can check out.
