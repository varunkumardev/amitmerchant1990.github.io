There are basically three ways using which you can get the latest updates from my blog: RSS, Newsletter or Twitter.

## RSS Feed

This blog supports [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) to deliver frequent updates. To subscribe to this blog, you need to have a RSS reader.

You can use one of [these readers](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/) which you can use to subscribe to the RSS feed. I'm using [Feeder](https://feeder.co) as a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp) on my desktop devices and [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) on my mobile device.

In order to subscribe to the RSS, you can head over to "www.amitmerchant.com" and the reader will pick up the feed if it finds one or you can manually add [https://www.amitmerchant.com/feed](https://www.amitmerchant.com/feed) to your favorite reader.

This is how my blog looks in my Feedly account.

You can subscribe to my newsletter [here](https://tinyletter.com/amitmerchant/subscribe).

## Twitter

You may follow me [@amit_merchant](https://twitter.com/amit_merchant) on Twitter, everything I write I announce on Twitter as well.
