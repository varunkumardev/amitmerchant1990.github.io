<h2 style="text-align: left;">Allo! Allo! Thank you for stopping by at my creative outlet. I'm Amit, a software engineer and tech blogger from India.</h2>

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the [Sarvajanik College Of Engineering & Technology, Surat](http://scet.ac.in) (Computer Science and Engineering, 2011).

I love exploring new technologies and playing around with them. I wrote my first line of code in third grade of school in a language called [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). I have started my professional web development journey building web apps using PHP and JavaScript. I have leveraged variety of MVC frameworks, the likes of [Laravel](http://laravel.com) to build dynamic web apps. In recent times, my interest shift towards JavaScript and more specifically towards server-side JavaScript. So, I've started to try my hands-on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Currently, I'm hacking into ~~[Electron](http://electron.atom.io)~~ [React](https://reactjs.org/) to create something beautiful.

I'm currently working at [ValueLabs](https://www.valuelabs.com). In my spare time, I love contributing towards the open source community by creating helpful [tools](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990), doing [photography & sketching](https://www.instagram.com/amit_merchant/), listening to [some music](https://music.amazon.in/user-playlists/56f836f23100415da095ac0b61f44c95i8n0) which ranges from rock to sufi to [Lo-fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music), going around with my beautiful wife and friends.

This blog is a place to brain-dump things which I learn on a daily basis. It has been setup using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I'm using [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) jekyll theme which I've heavily personalized to suit my need and taste.

Navigate to [this page](/uses) if you want to learn what all things I am using to get things done.
